# python-api-challenge
This challenged proved to be a very difficult one for me as I learned about all of the material when I was very sick. 
Despite this I feel that I understand the big topics from this challenge much better having completed it. I looked back
on much of the older material for this assignment, especially to understand what each part of the info_box_template 
mean. Having a decent understanding of the gmaps API and weathermaps API has given me a strong foundation for what it 
may look like to use API calls to pull from data on the internet. This assignment also has given me a better understanding
of how to read documentation from these APIs. I ran out of time on this one, but if I had more some future things to 
consider for next time include: finding a simpler way to complete linear regressions or just generally making a different
variable for vc_fit so I didn't have to recreate it each time and general formatting.
